### Enumerated Steps for Properly Sizing and Placing an Oropharyngeal Airway (OPA)

## **Using Airway Adjuncts**
   - Insert airway adjuncts to maintain an open airway if trained and necessary:
     - **Oropharyngeal Airway (OPA):** For unconscious patients without a gag reflex.
     - **Nasopharyngeal Airway (NPA):** For patients with a gag reflex or semi-conscious state.

1. **Scene Safety and Precautions**
   - Ensure the scene is safe before approaching the patient.
   - Don standard precautions (e.g., gloves, eye protection) to prevent contamination or infection.

2. **Evaluate the Patient’s Condition**
   - Confirm that the patient is unconscious or unresponsive.
   - Assess for the absence of a gag reflex, as the OPA should only be used in patients without a gag reflex to prevent aspiration or vomiting.

3. **Select the Appropriate OPA Size**
   - Measure the OPA for proper sizing by:
     - Placing the flange at the corner of the patient’s mouth.
     - Ensuring the distal end of the OPA aligns with the angle of the mandible (jawline).

4. **Prepare the Patient**
   - Position the patient supine on a flat surface.
   - Open the airway using the **head-tilt/chin-lift** technique or the **jaw-thrust** maneuver if a spinal injury is suspected.

5. **Insert the OPA (Standard Technique)**
   - Hold the OPA with the curved portion pointing upward (toward the roof of the mouth).
   - Insert the OPA into the mouth and rotate it 180 degrees as it passes the tongue. This prevents the tongue from blocking the airway during placement.

6. **Alternative Pediatric Technique (If Needed)**
   - For small children or infants, insert the OPA with the curve following the natural curve of the mouth (no rotation).
   - Use a tongue depressor to gently press the tongue down while inserting the OPA.

7. **Confirm Proper Placement**
   - Ensure the flange rests against the lips or teeth without forcing the OPA deeper.
   - Verify that the airway is unobstructed and that the patient is ventilating effectively.
   - Listen for airflow and observe chest rise and fall to confirm successful placement.

8. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Continuously monitor the patient for changes in airway status.
   - Reassess for any signs of gagging, discomfort, or airway obstruction, which may require removal or adjustment of the OPA.

9. **Document the Procedure**
   - Record the size of the OPA used, the steps taken during insertion, and the patient’s response to the procedure.
   - Communicate this information to other medical personnel as needed.

This structured approach ensures safe and effective sizing and placement of an oropharyngeal airway (OPA), adhering to proper emergency care protocols.
